## Repository

This repository contains two main branches:

* `dev`: The main development branch. We try to keep it stable in the sense of all tests are passing, but we don't recommend it for production systems.
* `stable`: Contains the latest stable release that we recommend for production use. Use this if you always want the latest version of OpenProject.
